## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
1. Version control is basically the process of tracking changes to codes or repositories overtime,
it keeps history of commits allowing the accession of previous version of a project or code.

GitHub is a platform built around git which allow developers to contribute to the development of
a code and easy switching between versions without conflict in development.

Version control can help in maintaining project integrity through the following :
● Collaboration of developers
● Review of codes
● Easy roll-back to previous versions
● Tracking of changes
● Understanding the stages of development

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
2. Setting up of a repository is like creating a directory that will package the project on GitHub.
   
It includes various steps such as:
1. Creating new repository from the dashboard
2. Naming the repository
3. Description
4. Making it public or private
5. Attaching a README file
6. Licensing
   
Important decisions to be taken during this creation are:
1. Mode of licensing
2. Making it public or private
3. Whether or not to attach README file
   
## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
3. README file is very important in a GitHub as it is the first point of contact in project that
present the essence and reason why it exist.
It is a brief introduction or instruction for
developers or contributors on a particular project.

README file will include
● Name
● Description
● Usage instructions
● Contributing terms
● Contact information

It contribute to effective collaboration by providing information that will guide project developers

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
4. Public repository
It is a repository that is open to any contributor to modify or use. It allow multiple developers to
contribute on a particular project leading to fast results. Meanwhile, it can lead to insecure of
sensitive files

Private repository
Private repository allow access to selected contributors. It is good for collaborate on proprietary
work and codes that are sensitive. Meanwhile, you have to be on a paid plan on GitHub to allow
more contributors to work on a private repository.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
5. Commits are detailed message that describe your change to a particular line of code or
repository.

It help in tracking changes by applying a particular hashtag to each commit.

Steps to making commit
1. Initialize a repository by applying "git init"
2. Add file by applying "git add"
3. Commit your changes by applying "git commit"
4. Push your changes to the GitHub with "git push".
   
## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
6. Branching in git is the process of creating new line of code from the main code.
   
It is important for collaboration on GitHub as it allow different contributors to modify the features
of a code without overwriting each others commit.

Process of branching
● To branch : git branch "branch name"
● To switch between branches : git checkout "branch name"
● To merge: git merge "main branch"

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
7. Pull request in GitHub is essential for reviewing code before its integration into the main
project.

It facilitate code review and collaboration by allowing members to discuss the accuracy of a
particular feature or code development.

Steps for creating and pull request include:
● Make your commits
● Create a pull request by navigating to pull request section on your dashboard
● Review and collaborate
● Merge when it is approved

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
8. Forking is the process of making a copy of someone's repository on your GitHub account
while cloning is the process of downloading a repository to your local computer.

Forking is particularly good for public repository and for short projects that need continuous
merging

While cloning is better for a long term usage of a particular repository on GitHub and other
platforms.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
9. Issues help in stating task and tracking bugs. While project board provide visual presentation
of task such as to do, in progress and done.
They are important for assigning task, evaluating
team, fixing bugs and getting feedback.

These tool can enhance collaborative effort through
● Collaboration
● Community
● Integration

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
10. Common challenges of GitHub
● Complicated platform navigation
● Insecurity
● Inadequate confidentiality
● Merge conflict

Best practice for version control are:
● Collaboration
● Pull request
● Evaluating the project board

Ensure smooth collaboration by:
● Applying ssh key
● Using private repository
● Adding favorable licensing terms
